# Reckless Amputator

A Caves of Qud mod that adds a quick and reliable method to remove your unwanted
body parts.


## Installation

Copy the `Source\RecklessAmputator` folder to the `Mods` folder of your Caves of
Qud installation. This is usually located under the
`%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Freehold Games\CavesOfQud` path. Once this is done, the
mod has to be enabled in the game's mod menu. Scripting mods must also be
allowed.


## Usage

 1. Properly equip either a long blade or an axe.

 4. Hope you brought some bandages.

It is possible to perform an amputation on a dominated entity, however, this
requires passing a willpower-based stat check.


## Compatibility

The mod was developed for version 2.0.202.104 of Caves of Qud.


## Development

The included project file expects the `Assembly-CSharp.dll` from your Caves of
Qud installation to be copied to the `Source` folder during development in order
to enable IntelliSense support in Visual Studio.
